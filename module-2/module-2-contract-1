### RS232
History: Intro in 1960s, one of the oldest serial communication protocols, originally designed for data exchange between teletypewriters and modems;
Length: Effective up to 15 meters (50 feet), though longer distances can be achieved at lower speeds or with high-quality cables;
Speed: Typically up to 115.2 Kbps, but can be higher with modern equipment;
Wiring: Simple point-to-point configuration with various pinouts; most common is the DB9 connector.

### RS485
History: Intro in 1980s as an improvement over RS232, RS485 supports longer cable lengths and higher speeds;
Length: Up to 1200 meters;
Speed: Can reach up to 10 Mbps at shorter distances;
Wiring: Uses a differential signaling method with twisted pair cables, allowing for multi-point connections, up to 32 devices.

### I2C
History: Dev by Philips in the 1980s for communication between chips on a circuit board;
Length: Designed for short distances, typically within a single device or circuit board;
Speed: Standard mode up to 100 Kbps, Fast mode up to 400 Kbps, and High-speed mode up to 3.4 Mbps;
Wiring: Two-wire bus (Serial Data Line (SDA) and Serial Clock Line (SCL)) and supports multiple masters and slaves.

### SPI
History: Dev by Motorola in the 1980s, primarily for short-distance communication in embedded systems;
Length: Intended for short distances, typically a few centimeters to a meter.
Speed: Can go up to several Mbps, depending on the specific implementation and system constraints;
Wiring: Uses a master-slave architecture with four lines: Master Out Slave In (MOSI), Master In Slave Out (MISO), Clock (SCK), and Slave Select (SS).

### OneWire
History: Developed by Dallas Semiconductor in the 1990s for low-speed communication with minimal wiring;
Length: Can be used for distances up to 100 meters, depending on the configuration and environment;
Speed: Standard speed up to 16.3 Kbps, with Overdrive mode allowing speeds up to 142 Kbps;
Wiring: Unique in that it requires only a single wire for data transmission, with the ground serving as a reference. Some devices also include a separate power line.

## (O) IoT Protocols - OK
MQTT - lightweight, publish-subscribe, machine to machine network protocol for message queue/message queuing service. Meant for remote devices which have limited opreational resources (processing power, bandwidth etc.).
CoAp - Constrained Application Protocol is a specialized Internet application protocol for constrained devices, as defined in RFC 7252. It enables those constrained devices called "nodes" to communicate with the wider Internet using similar protocols.
HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Used for all kinds of web services, e.g. sending web pages, REST API-s, etc.


## (M) Basic electronics prototyping - TODO
”Hello breadboard”
RGB LED color mixer


## (M) “Hello world”/Blink in C++ - OK
