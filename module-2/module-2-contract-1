## IoT Protocols
MQTT - lightweight, publish-subscribe, machine to machine network protocol for message queue/message queuing service. Meant for remote devices which have limited opreational resources (processing power, bandwidth etc.).
CoAp - Constrained Application Protocol is a specialized Internet application protocol for constrained devices, as defined in RFC 7252. It enables those constrained devices called "nodes" to communicate with the wider Internet using similar protocols.
HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Used for all kinds of web services, e.g. sending web pages, REST API-s, etc.
